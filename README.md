# CI/CD Pipeline Project

This project implements a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions, Docker, and a self-hosted runner. The pipeline is designed to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for applications.

## Features
- Automated Builds: Automatically build and test your application on every code push.
- Docker Integration: Containerize your application using Docker.
- Continuous Deployment: Deploy your application to a remote server automatically.
- Self-Hosted Runner: Utilize a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner for custom execution environments.

## Technologies Used
- GitHub Actions: For CI/CD automation.
- Docker: For containerization of applications.
- Bash: For scripting deployment processes.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account and a repository to set up the CI/CD pipeline.
- Docker installed on the server for container management.
- A server or machine with SSH access for deployment.

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
